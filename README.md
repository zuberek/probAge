## Overview

ProbAge is a Python package implementing the probabilistic model for epigenetic age acceleration analysis described in "Probabilistic inference of epigenetic age acceleration from cellular dynamics" (Nature Aging, 2024). This tool provides a mechanistic approach to understanding methylation dynamics and biological aging, addressing limitations in traditional epigenetic clock methods.

### Key Features

- Probabilistic modeling of methylation transitions at the cellular level
- Distinction between acceleration and bias components in methylation dynamics
- Robust inference framework tested on large-scale cohort data
- Compatible with both local execution and cloud-based analysis

## Installation

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zuberek/probage.git
cd probage
```

2. Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f env/probage.yml
conda activate probage
```

## Usage

### Local Analysis

Use `any_cohort_run_no_train.py` or `any_cohort_run_retrain.py` to analyze your cohort data locally, either by reusing a pretrained model in blood (fast) or refitting a model from scratch (slower but suited when analysing tissues other than blood).

1. Modify the data path in `any_cohort_run_no_train.py` or `any_cohort_run_retrain.py` to point to your methylation data.
2. Set global model parameters parameters.
3. Run the analysis:
```bash
python any_cohort_run.py
```

### Cloud-Based Analysis

Access our web interface at [https://probage.streamlit.app/](https://probage.streamlit.app/) for cloud-based analysis.

## Data Format

Your input data should include two components:

### 1. Methylation Data Matrix
- Format: Rows as CpG sites, columns as samples
- Values: Beta values (0-1 range) representing methylation levels
- File format: CSV or similar tabular format

### 2. Metadata File
Required columns:
- `age`: Numerical values representing the chronological age of each sample
- `control`: Boolean values (True/False) indicating which samples should be used for batch correction
  - Set to `True` for samples that represent the "normal" or "healthy" population
  - Set to `False` for samples from the group being studied (e.g., disease group)
  - Example: When studying disease acceleration, set `control=True` for healthy participants and `control=False` for disease participants
  - Example: When studying a cohort of healthy participants, set `control=True` for all participants.

Additional columns are encouraged and can be included for further analysis. Common examples:
- `sex`: Biological sex of the participant
- `smoking_status`: Smoking history
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `disease_status`: Specific conditions or phenotypes
- Any other sample-level information relevant to your analysis

Example metadata format:
```csv
sample_id,age,control,sex,smoking_status,treatment_group
SAMPLE_001,45,True,F,Never,Placebo
SAMPLE_002,52,True,M,Former,Placebo
SAMPLE_003,48,False,F,Current,Treatment
```

Note: The batch correction process uses only samples marked as `control=True` to establish the baseline methylation dynamics, ensuring that the acceleration estimates are not confounded by the condition being studied.

## Model Details

ProbAge introduces two key components for analyzing epigenetic aging:

1. **Acceleration**: Measures the proportional increase in methylation transition speeds across CpG sites
2. **Bias**: Quantifies global changes in methylation levels

These components provide mechanistic insights into aging-related methylation dynamics and help control for confounding factors in traditional epigenetic clock analyses.
